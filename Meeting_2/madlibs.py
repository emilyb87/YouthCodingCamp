# Vacation

'''A vacation is when you take a trip to some ADJECTIVE1 place 
with your ADJECTIVE2 family. Usually you go to some place
that is near a/an NOUN1 or up on a/an NOUN2.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride PLURAL_NOUN1
or play GAME or go hunting for PLURAL_NOUN2. I like
to spend my time VERB_ENDING_IN_ING1 or VERB_ENDING_IN_ING2.
Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an NOUN and got poison PLANT all
over his PART_OF_THE_BODY.'''

# Camping

'''YOUR_NAME and OTHER_NAME wanted to go camping.
First you needed a tent. You decided to make a tent
out of NOUN1 and NOUN2. Next you
packed other things you wouuld need for camping like
NOUN3 and NOUN4. You were ready to go!
You started VERBING1 into the woods.
You got nervous when you saw a NOUN5.
Then you realized it was just a silly NOUN6.
When you found a campsite you unpacked the NOUN7
and then decided to go VERBING2. Later you built 
a campfire using NOUN8 and NOUN9. It was very
ADJECTIVE1 and you sat around the file telling
ADJECTIVE2 stories. Finally it was time to go to sleep.'''
