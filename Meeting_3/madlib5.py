# Vacation

'''A vacation is when you take a trip to some ADJECTIVE1 place 
with your ADJECTIVE2 family. Usually you go to some place
that is near a/an NOUN1 or up on a/an NOUN2.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride PLURAL_NOUN1
or play GAME or go hunting for PLURAL_NOUN2. I like
to spend my time VERB_ENDING_IN_ING1 or VERB_ENDING_IN_ING2.
Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an NOUN and got poison PLANT all
over his PART_OF_THE_BODY.'''
